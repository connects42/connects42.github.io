# The Wow! Signal: A 72-Second Mystery from Deep Space

Consider this: On August 15, 1977,  Jerry Ehman, a volunteer at the Big Ear radio telescope at Ohio State University, was reviewing data from a search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).  He noticed an unusual signal, so strong it prompted him to circle it on the printout and scribble Wow! in the margin – hence the name.

* **The Signal's Strength:** The signal's strength was significantly above the background noise, exceeding the expected noise level by a factor of 30.  This wasn't just a faint whisper; it was a powerful, sustained broadcast.  It lasted for a full 72 seconds, the time it took for the radio telescope to track the source across the sky.

* **The Location:**  The signal originated from the direction of Sagittarius, a constellation rich in stars and located near the center of our galaxy – a region teeming with potential celestial bodies. The specific coordinates, however, have never been perfectly pinpointed due to the limitations of the Big Ear telescope.

* **The Frequency:** The signal was detected at a frequency of 1420.4056 MHz, a frequency very close to the 21-centimeter hydrogen line – a naturally occurring radio emission from hydrogen atoms.  This frequency is significant because it's considered a possible communication frequency for extraterrestrial civilizations, as it's a universally understood signal in the cosmos.

* **The Mystery Remains:** Despite extensive efforts, the Wow! Signal has never been detected again.  Theories abound, ranging from extraterrestrial communication to a highly unusual terrestrial interference source (though this is generally considered less likely due to the signal's strength and duration).   The Big Ear itself was decommissioned in 1998, removing the ability to easily attempt further observation at the original coordinates.

So, ponder this today:  A powerful, unexplained radio signal, lasting 72 seconds, potentially originating from deep space, remains one of the most compelling pieces of evidence in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life. Its origin and meaning continue to fascinate and challenge us, a reminder of the vast, unexplored mysteries that lie beyond our planet.
